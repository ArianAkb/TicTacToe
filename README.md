A react demo project containing a Tic-Tac-Toe game built watching Maximilian Schwarzmuler's react course.
ps: the styling is not done by me and it was pre done by the mentor, in this project I mostly followed the mentor's way of implementation because there were many features used in this project that i still didn't know of by the time.
